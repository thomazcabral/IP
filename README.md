# Introduction to Programming ðŸ’»ðŸ”¡
Welcome to my repository dedicated to basic programming in Python, where I document my learnings and implementations for the Introduction to Programming subject at CIn-UFPE.

## Organization
This repository is organized into folders, each one focusing on specific topics within basic Python. Here, you will find a variety of code examples to delve into.

### Lista0 (List 0)
- Introduction to Python, programming language that is used for all codes here.

### Lista1 (List 1)
- Conditionals

### Lista2 (List 2)
- For and While loops

### Lista3 (List 3)
- Lists and its functions

### Lista4 (List 4)
- Functions
- Python Variable Scope

### Lista5 (List 5)
- Recursion

### Lista6 (List 6)
- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Use of lambda functions along with the sorted() function

### Monitoria (Academic Monitoring)
- I had to create a problem to be a monitor of this subject, so I had to create:
- Problem statement
- Problem solution

## Observation
Some colleagues and I also created a project for this subject which is documented in the "ProjetoIP" repository.
